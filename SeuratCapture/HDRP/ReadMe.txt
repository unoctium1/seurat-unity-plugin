This folder contains scripts that allow the Seurat Capture to work with Unity's HD Render Pipeline.  The CaptureBuilder.cs script used the  SetReplacementShader, which does not work with the Scriptable Render Pipeline. To get around this, the scripts in this folder create a runtime renderpipeline for the depth camera and render the objects with a replacment material after caching the material values on all the renderers in the scene.
