HDRP Seurat Capture Shader modifications.
 
This folder contains modified versions of the standard Unity Technologies (tm)
shaders. These override the standard normalized window-space depth capture to 
produce eye-space Z in the red channel.

The shader has also been modified to support HDRP material properties without relying on a replacment shader tag.
